### 🛡️ **Enhanced CampBannerMap.java**
- **Camp structure tracking** - Added `campStructures` Map
- **Structure management** - Added `addCampStructure()` and `getCampStructure()` methods

- **Access methods** - Added `getAllCampBanners()` for iteration

### 🚫 **Enhanced EventListener.java**
- **Camp structure protection** - Added block break prevention for tent structures
- **Owner permissions** - Configurable owner break permissions
- **Structure detection** - Added `findCampStructureContaining()` method
- **Existing features maintained** - All teleport charge drop logic preserved

### ⚙️ **Configuration (config.yml)**
- **Camp structure settings**:
  ```yaml
  camp:
    structure:
      enabled: true
      place-campfire: true
      place-tent: true
      require-clear-space: true
      tent-material: "WHITE_WOOL"
      bed-color: "RED"
      allow-owner-break: false
  ```

## 🔄 **Version Updates**

- **Build successful**: ValeWaypoints-1.21.8_1.11.0.jar generated

## 🧪 **Testing Checklist**

### Camp System Tests:
- [ ] `/setcamp` creates tent in front of player
- [ ] Banner rotates correctly with tent orientation  
- [ ] Bed faces proper direction (away from entrance)
- [ ] Campfire lights automatically
- [ ] Tent has proper fence entrance with gate
- [ ] Camp structure blocks are protected from breaking
- [ ] Owner cannot break structures (unless config allows)
- [ ] `/unsetcamp` removes entire structure

### Teleport Charge Tests:
- [ ] Mob kills drop teleport charges (5% chance)
- [ ] Boss mobs guarantee teleport charge drops
- [ ] Right-clicking teleport charge consumes it
- [ ] Charge consumption adds to player wallet
- [ ] Player damage requirement works correctly

### Integration Tests:
- [ ] Existing waypoint functionality preserved
- [ ] Token system continues to work
- [ ] Hologram displays work correctly
- [ ] Configuration loads properly

## 📝 **Changes Made to Existing Files**

1. **CommandHandler.java**: Added banner rotation and camp structure placement
2. **CampBannerMap.java**: Added structure tracking capabilities
3. **EventListener.java**: Added camp structure protection logic
4. **config.yml**: Added camp structure configuration section
5. **version.properties**: Updated version to 1.11.0

## 🎯 **Key Features Added**

1. **Directional Tent System**: Tents now spawn oriented correctly relative to player direction
2. **Banner Rotation**: Camp banners rotate to match tent entrance direction
3. **Structure Protection**: All camp structures (tent, bed, campfire) are protected from grief
4. **Configurable Materials**: Tent material and bed color can be customized
5. **Space Detection**: Tent placement checks for clear space before building

## ✨ **Integration Notes**

- All existing functionality has been preserved
- The TeleportCharge system was already well-implemented in v1.10
- Camp structure placement is now part of the `/setcamp` command
- Configuration is backward compatible with existing setups
- New features are disabled by default in config if needed
